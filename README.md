==================================================================

A set of experiments were summarized in a tidy data set to demonstrate the mean and standard deviation of measurements taken from 30 volunteers performing six activities ( (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smart phone. 


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'Codebook.txt':  List of variables with their units and other information

- 'run_analysis.R': R code that processes the original data set into a summarized, tidy data set.
